# AI-Assisted Development Strategy

## Principles

### 1. Atomic Design
- Break down features into the smallest possible units.
- Each component should have a single responsibility.
- Minimize dependencies between components.
- Use clear interfaces for communication.

### 2. Documentation First
Before implementing any feature:
- Document the interface.
- Define expected behaviors.
- List potential side effects.
- Specify error conditions.

### 3. Code Organization
Follow these steps when adding new code:
1. Define public interfaces.
2. Document expected behavior.
3. Break down into atomic units.
4. Add comprehensive tests.
5. Implement the smallest unit first.

### 4. LLM Consultation Process

Before making changes:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[New Feature/Change] --> B[Document Requirements]
    B --> C[Break Down into Atomic Units]
    C --> D[Define Interfaces]
    D --> E[Identify Side Effects]
    E --> F[Generate Test Cases]
    F --> G[Implement]
```

### 5. Code Review Checklist

- [ ] Is each component atomic?
- [ ] Are interfaces well-defined?
- [ ] Are side effects documented?
- [ ] Is error handling comprehensive?
- [ ] Are tests complete?

### 6. Project Structure Guidelines
