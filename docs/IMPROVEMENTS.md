# Improvement Plan

## Summary
- Consolidate repetitive test routines into reusable utility functions.
- Standardize error handling patterns across handlers and repositories.
- Refactor modules to enhance clarity and separation of concerns.

## Action Items
1. Move common test code into `common.rs`.
2. Check for repeated data structures and centralize them in `models.rs`.
3. Simplify repository logic:
   - Minimize duplicated CRUD code.
   - Utilize generics or traits where possible.
4. Introduce more integration tests for edge cases:
   - Concurrent updates.
   - Handling of invalid data.
5. Update `TESTING.md` with new coverage goals once changes are applied.

## Concurrency Tests
- Added a shared concurrency helper in `test_utils.rs`.
- Refactored `test_concurrent_quiz_updates` to call this helper.

## Latest Improvements
- Added comprehensive test helpers in common.rs
- Enhanced repository tests with CRUD scenarios
- Improved error handling with specific variants
- Updated test coverage goals and documentation

## Next Steps
1. Implement performance benchmarks
2. Add stress testing scenarios
3. Enhance concurrent operation testing
4. Improve error recovery mechanisms
